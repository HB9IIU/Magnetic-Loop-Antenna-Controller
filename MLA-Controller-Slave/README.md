# ESP32 Master Microcontroller for TFT Touchscreen Control

This repository contains the code for the **ESP32 microcontroller** functioning as the **MASTER** device in a radio control system. The MASTER is equipped with a TFT touchscreen interface, providing users with a graphical interface to control and monitor the system's operations.

## Overview

The MASTER device communicates with a SLAVE ESP32 microcontroller, which manages a stepper motor via a microstepping driver. This setup enables precise control of mechanical movements in various applications, such as antenna positioning for radio transceivers.
